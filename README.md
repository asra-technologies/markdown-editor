## Git Rules
Using git is easy, using multiple granches can be a bit tricky. There is one branch per release, when the release is complete the branch is to be merged into master. NO COMMITS must be made to master.

Any changes to gitignore, or to gitatributes must be done on the branch git, this branch can then be merged into the release branch or what ever branch in order to get the commit.
